# RGB LED Cube prototype

A set of scripts and simple code for a basic glowing RGB led cube. 

# Abstract

An LED wifi enabled cube that displays ambient information, such as weather, through glowing colors. It will be controlled by both a web and mobile app.

Ambient notifications sit in-between being notified and not. In the current binary notification system, an invite to play Candy Crush on Facebook gets the same attention as a text message. Users will be able to create their own notification hierarchy.
